### About The Project

Terminal-based fight simulator.  
With a fake-real time fight mechanic, two teams duel to death, with each of their member attacking a certain time per turn depending on their class, and generate enmity to set themselves as the recipient of the attacks.  
Currently, the teams are hard set in the code. User generated teams through an interface to be added.
